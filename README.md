# Portrait-Genre-GANs
Using Generative Adversarial Networks to transform portraits from one artistic genre to another. 

## About
A project for Cornell Tech's fall Applied Machine Learning class in which we merge the ideas of creating Monet's using a cycleGAN (https://www.kaggle.com/c/gan-getting-started) with recent research into the StarGAN architecture (https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.09020)
